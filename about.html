                        <p>TEDxYouth@Tehran is part of the TEDxYouth initiative by TED. On and around the time of Universal Children’s Day, several cities and communities host a TEDxYouth event. While each event is different in format, size and theme, they have a shared vision: inspiring creativity, igniting innovation, and empowering the youth. TEDxYouth@Tehran is based on a central premise that every young person is the captain of their destiny, the master of their life. They need to take responsibility for their life, be independent thinkers and explore their imagination. They need to feel empowered and bold to do game-changing innovations, technologies and businesses. We design our event theme and invite speakers to give the youth a sense of hope, examples of role models, ideas to innovate and create, and to reach their full potential</p>

                    <h3>About TED</h3>
                    <p> TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a conference in California 1984, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.At a TED conference, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian Greene, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. </p>

                    <h3>What's TEDx?</h3>
                    <p> In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxTehran, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxTehran event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized. </p>
